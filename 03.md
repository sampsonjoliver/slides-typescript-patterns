# It's all JavaScript in the end

## The difference between TS and JS is perceived only by the developer writing it

- Typescript does **not** add classes. ECMA-262 (ES6) adds classes.
- Typescript does **not** enforce object types at runtime because it doesn't exist at runtime.
- Typescript does **not** provide any opinions on how you should handle type-safety, null-checking, etc at runtime
- Typescript does **not** provide any opinions on how you should approach object inheritance
