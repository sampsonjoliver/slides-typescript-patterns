# It's all JavaScript in the end

## So what is Typescript, anyway?

Well, it's JavaScript. Plus some other stuff that's pretty much meaningless. Let's get theoretical...

```
⊃ indicates a Proper Superset.

∈ indicates set membership.
```

e.g.

```
A ⊃ B implies that A has B's elements and more.

A ∈ {B, C} implies that A is composed of B and C's elements.
```

typescriptlang.org states _"TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types."_ That's it.

Using our notation above...

```ts
Typescript ⊃ Javascript // Typescript contains Javascript's elements and more
```

or

```
Typescript ∈ { Javascript, Type Info }, where
Type Info ≠ Runtime-executable code
```

> **Fact #2:** TypeScript is just JavaScript with some type information that is completely erasable and has **_zero impact_** on runtime behaviour.
